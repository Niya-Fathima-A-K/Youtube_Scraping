DISCLAIMER: this is a skincare prop and not fully filled with skincare!

I love sharing new products and their benefits! Skincare is so personal and what works for one person may not work for another! I only share products that I like. Every product I post, I have used in my personal routine before. It’s so important for everyone to do their own research and not rely solely on influencer recommendations. My goal is simply to introduce products in a creative way that might be beneficial for your skin, so you can make informed choices that work best for you!💗
